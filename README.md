<p> Copyright is wrong, it's just another word of thievery. The action of stealing another persons work is absolutely disgusting. By stealing an authors work you are taking away their hardwork that was put into that project, artwork, assignment, website, film, picture, etc. So please for the love of all things holey follow the copyright laws. <p>
